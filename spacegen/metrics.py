"""Evaluation metrics (T16, Tech Spec 7), shared by the baselines and the neural pipeline.

Per sample (score_layouts): valid (H1 to H4), summed pairwise overlap area, reachability
ratio and rule quality. Across the valid layouts of one room (diversity): the mean over
pairs of the mean over shared slots of (centre distance + 0.5 m if the canonical rotations
differ). Layouts must be in canonical form, so a coffee table turned 180 degrees or a side
table turned any way is not a difference; the living room has no interchangeable slots.
