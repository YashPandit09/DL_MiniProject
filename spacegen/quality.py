"""Soft quality score S in [0, 1] (T09, Tech Spec 3.4).

S = w_align S_align + w_relations S_rel + w_circulation S_circ + w_space S_space, with the
weights and every threshold in configs/rules.yaml (all of them our own assumptions):

- S_align: share of the room's against-wall items standing within wall_distance of a wall
  with their back to it. Symmetric items have no back, so they count by position only.
- S_rel: mean score of the relations that apply. A relation is skipped when one of its
  items is absent. Each relation scores 1 inside its range and falls linearly to 0 at
  relation_falloff outside it.
- S_circ: share of the free floor (cells outside every footprint) that is walkable.
- S_space: 1 while furniture covers a share of the floor inside space_band, falling
  linearly to 0 at space_falloff outside it.
