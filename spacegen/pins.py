"""Pinned furniture (T38; Tech Spec 5.1 and E12): the user fixes an item, the method arranges the rest.

A Pin is a requested centre in meters and, optionally, a facing. Every method treats it the same
way in the end: the pinned item is put exactly on its spot (snap), so the pin holds by
construction, and the rule checker then decides whether the layout around it is valid.

  M2      latent optimization pulls the item towards its pin (lambda_pin) with its facing fixed,
          then the item is snapped (spacegen.pipeline.LatentOptSampler)
  M1      the CVAE's sample, snapped (spacegen.pipeline.CVAESampler)
  G0-pin  a generator layout with the pinned item moved onto its spot (PinnedSampler)
  B1, B2  the pinned item placed first, the others sampled; B2 redraws them against it
