"""Layouts as 4-channel images, the input of the CNN evaluator (T07, Tech Spec 4.2).

Each pixel holds the exact fraction of its area that a shape covers, so moving an item by
a centimetre changes the pixel values. The canvas has a fixed physical size with the room
at its origin, so a meter spans the same number of pixels in every room. Channels:

  0  room        coverage of the room rectangle
  1  furniture   coverage summed over the items, so an overlap shows as values above 1
  2  fronts      a thin band inside each item's front face; symmetric items get a band on
                 every equivalent face, so their arbitrary stored rotation does not show
  3  door zone   coverage of the door clearance zone

Pixel [i, j] covers x in [i s, (i+1) s] and y in [j s, (j+1) s], with s = canvas / pixels.

An axis-aligned box covers a pixel by (its overlap with the pixel's column) times (its
overlap with the pixel's row), so each channel is a sum of outer products of 1-D overlaps:
one batched matrix product on the GPU. It is also piecewise linear in the item positions,
so gradients reach the positions (needed for the surrogate variant M3).
